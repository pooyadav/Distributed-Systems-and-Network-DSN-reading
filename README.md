# Federated_Learning_Reading_Group


# Monday 31st August 2020, 11 am (UK time)

We will be discussing four papers in an informal setting (students' led activity): 

1. Federated Optimization in Heterogeneous Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127)
2. FedPD: A Federated Learning Framework with Optimal Rates and Adaptivity to Non-IID Data (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11418)
3. Bayesian Nonparametric Federated Learning of Neural Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12022)
4. Decentralized Federated Multi-Task Learning and System Design (https://fl.chaoyanghe.com/)
