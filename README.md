# Distributed Systems and Networks (DSN) reading group

In this group we read many cross-sectional papers discussing Machine Learning, IoT, Networks and system Design, Security and Wireless communications. 

If you like to join us, please ping me at poonam.yadav[at]york.ac.uk, would be happy to send online meeting invite.

# Monday 23rd November 2020, 11 am - 12noon (UK time)

We will be discussing four papers in an informal setting (students' led activity): 

1. CoLearn: enabling federated learning in MUD-compliant IoT edge networks (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3378679.3394528) and 
2. Network service dependencies in commodity internet-of-things devices (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3302505.3310082) (Poonam)
3. Sensor Calibration Fingerprinting for Smartphones, https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2019/papers/405.pdf (Poonam, Jack).
4. Automatic Identification and Blocking of Non-Critical IoT Traffic Destinations - https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07133 (Rian McQuillan-Howard)
This paper looks on mainly DNS traffic and filters traffic which is not required for local functioning. 
5. A Practical Approach for Taking Down Avalanche Botnets Under Real-World Constraints - https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/a-practical-approach-for-taking-down-avalanche-botnets-under-real-world-constraints/ This paper is interesting, look at a proactive approach on identifying domain names which are most likely registered by bots or malacious actors to register Domain names, generally by automating the large sets of domains that the malware
families of Avalanche generate through domain generation algorithms (DGAs).
6. Encrypted DNS =â‡’ Privacy? A Traffic Analysis Perspective - https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09682 This paper discusses DNS related issues in the network such as enabling manipulation, redirection, surveillance, and censorship and evaluates if encrypted DNS preserves privacy.
